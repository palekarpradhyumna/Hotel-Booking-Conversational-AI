# Conversational Hotel Booking AI

This project is a Conversational AI system that allows users to search and book hotels using natural language.  
The AI collects user preferences such as city, date, room type, and budget, and fetches hotel data using an OpenAPI-based backend tool.

## Features
- Natural language hotel search
- OpenAPI tool integration
- Backend built with FastAPI
- Clean JSON responses with proper data types
- Tool-compatible schema for Conversational AI platforms
- Real-time API testing using ngrok

## Tech Stack
- Python
- FastAPI
- OpenAPI 3.0
- Conversational AI (Tool Calling)
- HTTPX
- Ngrok

## Project Architecture
User → Conversational AI → OpenAPI Tool → FastAPI Backend → Hotel Data
